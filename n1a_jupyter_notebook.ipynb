    "This course is teaches you all of the tools you need automate repetitive reporting -- starting from the basics: Jupyter, Python and Mito. \n",
    "\n",
    "The course focuses on building Python skills that will be helpful to you in practice, leaving behind a lot of the theoretical explanations you might find in other courses. \n",
    "\n",
    "And be asured: There won't be any theoretical explainations with technical terms.  \n",
    "This course is handons where you will learn the concepts that you need to know for real-live application.  \n",
    "At one point you will realize that writing automation tools in python can be very satisfying!  \n",
    "Our job from mito is to make sure to get you there over the next days.\n",

    "* üßë‚Äçüíª -> the Person Behind Computer emoji means thers an **task** waiting for you.\n",
    "* This is not an exam, it's an opportunity to learn something new. You will get stuck at some point -- don't hesitate to ask questions to the Mito team, your colleagues, or Stack Overflow.\n",
