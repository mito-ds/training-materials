    "The course focuses on building Python skills that will be helpful to you in practice, leaving behind a lot of the theoretical explanations you might find in other courses. \n",

    "The goal of this course is to demistify the Python basics so you have the confidence to start applying Python automations in your day-to-day work.\n",

    "* üí° -> the lightbulb emoji means thers an **important information**.\n",
    "* üßë‚Äçüíª -> the Person Behind Computer emoji means thers an **task** waiting for you.\n",
    "* This is not an exam, it's an opportunity to learn something new. You will get stuck at some point -- don't hesitate to ask questions to the Mito team, your colleagues, or Stack Overflow.\n",
    "* Most imporantly: Enjoy the joureny!"
